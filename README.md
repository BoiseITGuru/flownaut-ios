# Flownaut for iPadOS

## Overview

Welcome to the iPadOS port of Flownaut, a Web3/Cadence based wargame originally inspired by [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) and an extension of [Emerald Academy](https://academy.ecdao.org/en). This version has been specifically tailored for iPad users, offering a seamless and engaging experience on Apple's tablet platform.

Flownaut challenges players to 'hack' through various levels, each represented by a unique smart contract. This iPadOS port maintains the open-source spirit of the original game, inviting players to delve into a world of strategic problem-solving.

## iPadOS Port Features

- **Optimized for iPad**: Enhanced user interface and design tailored for the iPad experience.
- **Touchscreen Gameplay**: Intuitive interaction through the iPad's touchscreen capabilities.

### Note on Adding New Levels

While this repository is dedicated to the iPadOS port, all new level contributions should be made to the [original Flownaut repository](https://github.com/emerald-dao/flownaut/tree/main/src/lib/content/flownaut). This ensures that new content is integrated across all platforms, including the upcoming visionOS version.

## Future Plans

- **visionOS Expansion**: We are excited about the future development for visionOS, aiming to bring unique features and innovative gameplay to this new platform.
